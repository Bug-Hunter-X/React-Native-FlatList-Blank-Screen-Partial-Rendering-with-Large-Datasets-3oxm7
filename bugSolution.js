The solution involves optimizing the FlatList component to handle large datasets more efficiently.  Using `windowSize` and `getItemLayout` significantly improves performance:

```javascript
// bugSolution.js
<FlatList
  data={largeArray}
  renderItem={({ item }) => <ListItem item={item} />}
  keyExtractor={(item) => item.id}
  windowSize={10} // Adjust as needed
  getItemLayout={(data, index) => ({ 
    length: ListItem.height, // Assuming ListItem height is consistent 
    offset: ListItem.height * index, 
    index 
  })}
/>
```

**Explanation:**

* `windowSize`: This prop controls how many items are rendered around the visible area.  A smaller number reduces memory usage at the cost of potentially more re-renders as the user scrolls.
* `getItemLayout`: This prop pre-calculates the position of each item. This dramatically speeds up rendering, especially with large datasets, by avoiding unnecessary measurements and layout calculations.  Ensure that `ListItem.height` accurately represents the height of your list item.
