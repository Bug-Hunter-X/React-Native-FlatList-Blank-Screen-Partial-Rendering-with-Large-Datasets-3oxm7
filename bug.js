This error occurs when using the FlatList component in React Native and you try to render a large number of items.  It manifests as a blank screen or a screen that only partially renders items. This is due to limitations in how FlatList handles rendering and memory management when dealing with numerous components.

```javascript
// Buggy code - renders a very large list
<FlatList
  data={largeArray}
  renderItem={({ item }) => <ListItem item={item} />}
  keyExtractor={(item) => item.id}
/>
```
